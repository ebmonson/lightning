Math
====

It would be convenient if we could use math markup in our documentation, like so: :math:`e^{i\pi} = -1`.

Or, in more complicated instances, like this:

.. math::

    L &= \int_{\Omega} F d\Omega \\
      &= 4 \pi d_L^2 F.

In the source you can see that the multline math environment works like the LaTeX ``align`` environment.
